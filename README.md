# CUDA Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress in mastering CUDA programming and High-Performance Computing (HPC).
My goal is to understand the hardware architecture deeply and write highly optimized kernels.

## Environment
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
- **Toolkit:** CUDA 13.1
- **Profiler:** NVIDIA Nsight Compute / Nsight Systems

## Project List
